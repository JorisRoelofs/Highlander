This folder mostly contains files generated by GameMaker, which are much more easily navigated by opening Highlander.yyp in GameMaker.
Other than that, this folder contains folders for dumping assets and builds, named _assets and _builds respectively.

WARNING:
Do not create a new file in GameMaker (sound, script, object, etc.) and then push or pull on Github without warning me.
This will likely result in a merge conflict in the source code, making the entire project unuseable until I fix it.
Editing existing files should be fine.

Also when editing files outside of GameMaker while GameMaker is open, e.g. by pulling on Github, GameMaker will likely ask whether you want to reload the files. Just press OK.
